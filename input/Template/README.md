Use this directory to setup a simulation from scratch. Each file should come with a README.md file describing what this case is doing, how to use it and what results are expected. Follow the following format:

# Name of case

Provide a brief description about the case, geometry, mesh, freestream condition, etc.

# Usage

provide instructions on how to run this case

# Expected results

Write what results are expected so the case setup can be validated if changed. If custom post-processing steps are performed, mention these here and explain what the results will show.
