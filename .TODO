# --------------------------- #
# Roadmap towards version 3.0 #
# --------------------------- #

☐ Testing
  ✔ Refactor code so that classes emit text / strings but do not write, delegate that to the file_manager class @done(23-01-17 07:10)
    ✔ 0 directory @done(23-01-05 08:18)
    ✔ constant directory @done(23-01-03 07:41)
    ✔ system directory @done(23-01-17 07:10)
  ✔ Provide unit-tests for 0 directory @done(23-01-05 08:18)
  ✔ Provide unit-tests for constant directory @done(23-01-03 07:41)
  ✔ Provide unit-tests for system directory @done(23-01-17 07:10)
  ☐ Rethink system tests, find a way to test automatically, without manually adding cases. Should also test all turbulence models!
  ☐ Set up CI/CD server

✔ File properties @done(23-01-12 08:27)
  ✔ Implement cascading file properties, deriving from a base case and then overwriting only specific quantities. This can be any test case from which properties will be derived @done(23-01-12 08:26)
  ✔ Establish a way to set private variables per class in constructor which will be used when setting the file properties dictionary @done(23-01-12 08:26)

☐ Refactoring
  ✔ Rething global parameter handling, instead of globals use Enums? Should still be int based in input to avoid typos. @done(23-01-09 08:04)
  ✔ Take isoSurface include out of additional fields and put in controlDict file, ensure correct order there @done(23-01-17 08:05)
  ✔ Provide case factory class that generates cases based on command line arguments @done(23-01-17 07:31)

☐ Features
  ☐ Retire DFSEM inlet boundary condition, replace by offset BC instead
  ☐ Add a material properties database (as json implementation), implement air and use that in thermophysical properties instead

☐ Cases
  ☐ Provide an internal and external LES example case setup
  ✔ Redo case file directory structure, currently input and example folders are missleading and should be combined @done(23-01-12 08:04)
  ☐ Provide FFT calculation to cylinder case setup so that Strouhal number can be executed
  ☐ Provide plotting script to Sudden Expansion

☐ Scripts
  ☐ Provide custom function object for residuals (L0 and L2 norm) with python script to extract and plot data
  ☐ Provide script for LES (calculate percentage of domain that resolves scales (should be 80% or above))

☐ Solver extensions
  ☐ Allow for custom solvers / postProcessing functions to be compiled as part of the case setup

☐ Documentation
  ☐ Provide readthedocs page

☐ GUI
  ☐ Provide initial implementation with wxPython to set up cases (later, extend towards meshing with OpenGL as well)
  ☐ Provide a way to use existing cases as tempaltes in file menu
  ☐ Provide a setup wizard to set up cases quickly

☐ Parameterisation
  ☐ Provide velocity template functionality within any script that ends in *.vel (automatically add python layer to transform *.vel file into normal openfoam file)
